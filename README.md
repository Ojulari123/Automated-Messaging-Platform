# Automated-Messaging-Platform
A small, reliable, easy-to-use web-based system that automatically sends occasion messages (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries) to approved community members(Admin controls approval &amp; membership). Messages use reusable templates so the admin doesnâ€™t have to compose them manually

The abbreviation 'AMS' is used throughout the source code and database to refer to the Automated Messaging System, for the sake of brevity.
